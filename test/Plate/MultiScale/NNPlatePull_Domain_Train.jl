"FE2 multiscale approach for modelling the elastoviscoplastic behaviour of long fibre SiC/Ti composite materials." 
Computer methods in applied mechanics and engineering 183.3-4 (2000): 309-330.

Geometry:
The plate size is 30 mm by 5mm 
These fibres are made of SiC with diameter about 0.65mm,
The volume fraction is about 33%. 

Domain: 60k by 10k
fibers: k by k
fiber number 200

Property:
Fibers are made of SiC, which are assumed to be isotropic and elastic, with
